# signedxml test data

Test data files in this directory are copied from the
[signedxml](https://github.com/leifj/signedxml) Go library (`testdata/` directory).

They are used by `bergshamra-dsig` and `bergshamra-c14n` unit tests to verify
signature validation against real-world SAML, WS-Federation, and other signed
XML documents.
